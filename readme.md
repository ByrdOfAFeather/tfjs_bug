Please download the longleaf_model directory from
this google drive link: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GB_cNpzoc3T4yg5mFVay83rBQYdE9a3g/view?usp=sharing



Then you can run the freeze_model_v2 to get the .pb for tensorflowjs 
conversion, note that in the CHECKPOINT file you will have 
to change the directories. 

and serve.py (plus the debug menu in your browser) to test loading it.
